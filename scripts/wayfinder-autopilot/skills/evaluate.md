## Core capabilities

### 1. Heuristic evaluation

Apply Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics as a structured evaluation framework. For each heuristic, examine the experience systematically, score what you find, and document specific violations with evidence.

**Scoring scale:** 0 = No issues found. 1 = Cosmetic issue (fix if time allows). 2 = Minor usability issue (low priority fix). 3 = Major usability issue (important to fix, high priority). 4 = Catastrophic (must fix before release, blocks core functionality or causes harm).

**The 10 heuristics, applied:**

**H1: Visibility of system status.** The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time. Look for: loading indicators during waits, progress bars for multi-step processes, confirmation after actions, clear indication of current state (selected, active, saved). Common violations: silent submissions (user clicks "save" and nothing visibly happens), no loading state during API calls, ambiguous toggle states, forms that submit without confirmation.

**H2: Match between system and real world.** The system should speak the user's language, with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Look for: natural language in labels and instructions, logical ordering of information, metaphors that match user expectations. Common violations: developer jargon in error messages ("Error 403: Forbidden"), database field names as labels ("created_at"), alphabetical sorting where frequency-based would serve better, icons that require insider knowledge.

**H3: User control and freedom.** Users often perform actions by mistake and need a clearly marked "emergency exit." Look for: undo functionality, cancel buttons in processes, back navigation that preserves state, ability to dismiss or close anything the system opened. Common violations: no undo after delete, multi-step flows with no back button, modals that can't be closed with Escape, actions that can't be reversed without contacting support.

**H4: Consistency and standards.** Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Look for: consistent terminology (same action = same label everywhere), consistent interaction patterns (buttons behave the same way across views), platform conventions respected. Common violations: "Save" in one place, "Submit" in another for the same action; different navigation patterns on different pages; custom UI that ignores platform conventions without good reason.

**H5: Error prevention.** Even better than good error messages is a careful design that prevents problems in the first place. Look for: confirmation dialogs for destructive actions, inline validation before submission, constraints that prevent invalid input, smart defaults that reduce errors. Common violations: no confirmation before delete, validation only on submit (not inline), free-text fields where selection would prevent errors, no character limits shown until exceeded.

**H6: Recognition rather than recall.** Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. Look for: visible options (menus, dropdowns, suggestions), recent items and history, contextual help, labels on icons. Common violations: icon-only toolbars with no tooltips, search-only navigation (no browsing), reference numbers users must memorize, settings pages with no indication of current values.

**H7: Flexibility and efficiency of use.** Accelerators — unseen by the novice user — may often speed up the interaction for the expert user. Look for: keyboard shortcuts, bulk actions, customizable workflows, saved preferences, power-user features that don't complicate the novice experience. Common violations: no keyboard shortcuts for frequent actions, no bulk operations for list management, forced linear flows with no ability to skip known steps, no way to set defaults.

**H8: Aesthetic and minimalist design.** Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with the relevant units and diminishes their relative visibility. Look for: clear visual hierarchy, content prioritization, whitespace used effectively, only relevant information displayed in context. Common violations: cluttered dashboards showing everything at once, competing calls to action on the same screen, decorative elements that distract from content, information overload in tables or lists.

**H9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors.** Error messages should be expressed in plain language, precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. Look for: specific error messages that name the problem, suggested fixes in error states, clear paths to recovery, error messages near the element that caused them. Common violations: generic "Something went wrong" messages, error codes without explanation, error messages far from the error source, no suggested recovery action.

**H10: Help and documentation.** Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Look for: contextual help (tooltips, inline guidance), searchable documentation, task-oriented help (not feature-oriented), easy to find and focused on the user's task. Common violations: no help available, help that documents features instead of tasks, FAQ pages that don't answer actual frequent questions, documentation that's outdated or contradicts the UI.

### 2. Cognitive walkthrough

For each key task flow, walk through every step and ask four questions. Where the answer is "no," you've found a UX failure.

**The four questions per step:**

1. **Will the user try to achieve the right effect?** (Motivation) Does the user understand what they need to do at this point? Is the goal of the current step clear? Or does the user not realize they need to take this action at all?

2. **Will the user notice that the correct action is available?** (Visibility) Is the button, link, or input visible and recognizable? Or is it buried in a menu, below the fold, styled like body text, or otherwise hidden?

3. **Will the user associate the correct action with the desired effect?** (Understanding) Does the label, icon, or affordance clearly communicate what will happen? Or could the user reasonably think this button does something else?

4. **If the correct action is performed, will the user see progress?** (Feedback) After the action, does the interface confirm what happened? Does the user know they succeeded, or are they left wondering?

**How to conduct it:**

Define the task. List every step required to complete it. For each step, answer all four questions. Document every "no" — that's a specific, locatable UX failure. Note: a "no" on question 1 (motivation) is the most severe — the user won't even try. A "no" on question 4 (feedback) means the user will try but won't know if they succeeded.

Rate each step: Pass (all four "yes"), Hesitation (one "no," likely recoverable), Failure (two or more "no," user likely abandons or errors).

### 3. Anti-pattern detection

Systematically scan the experience against the Intent anti-pattern catalog. This is not a theoretical exercise — these patterns cause measurable user harm and carry regulatory risk in many jurisdictions.

**Categories to scan:**

**Deceptive patterns.** Confirmshaming (guilt-tripping users who decline: "No, I don't want to save money"). Trick questions (confusing double negatives in opt-outs). Disguised ads (content that looks like navigation or editorial but is advertising). Bait and switch (offering one thing, delivering another). Hidden costs (fees that appear only at checkout). Roach motels (easy to get in, hard to get out — easy signup, impossible cancellation).

**Prechecked and default manipulation.** Prechecked consent boxes. Opt-out instead of opt-in for data sharing. Asymmetric consent (one click to accept, five steps to decline). Bundled consent (all-or-nothing permission grants). Default settings that favor the business over the user.

**Urgency and scarcity fabrication.** Fake countdown timers. "Only 2 left!" when inventory is not actually scarce. "3 people are viewing this right now" pressure. Limited-time offers that reset. Social proof fabrication.

**Addictive design.** Infinite scroll with no natural stopping point. Streak mechanics that punish absence. Variable reward schedules (pull-to-refresh gambling). Notifications designed to re-engage rather than inform. Autoplay that prevents deliberate content selection.

**Attention exploitation.** Notification spam. Dark nudges (making the business-preferred option visually dominant). Misdirection (drawing attention away from important information). Nagging (repeated prompts for actions the user has declined).

**Accessibility weaponized.** Using low contrast or small text to de-emphasize unfavorable terms. Hiding unsubscribe links. Making cancellation flows deliberately inaccessible. Burying privacy controls behind multiple navigation layers.

**Vulnerable user exploitation.** Targeting patterns at children, elderly users, or users in financial distress. Payday loan interfaces designed to obscure APR. Children's games with deceptive purchase flows.

**AI-specific dark patterns.** Anthropomorphizing AI to build unwarranted trust. Opacity about AI decision-making that affects users. AI-driven personalization that exploits psychological vulnerabilities. Recommendation systems optimizing engagement over wellbeing.

**Common UX failures.** Mystery meat navigation (unlabeled icons, unclear links). Dead-end pages (no next action). Silent failures (action fails with no notification). Inconsistent mental models. Forced registration before value. Unnecessary data collection.

**Severity classification:** Critical = Causes direct harm, likely violates regulations (GDPR, ADA, FTC guidelines). High = Significant manipulation or user detriment. Medium = Questionable practices, borderline patterns. Low = Minor issues, likely unintentional.

### 4. Task success analysis

Define the key tasks users need to accomplish, then evaluate each one against concrete metrics.

**For each task, evaluate:**

- **Completion**: Can the user actually finish the task? Is there a clear path from intent to success? Are there dead ends, circular paths, or missing steps?
- **Efficiency**: How many steps does it take? How many of those steps are necessary vs. unnecessary friction? What's the minimum viable path?
- **Error rate**: Where in the task do users hesitate, make mistakes, or need to backtrack? What causes the errors — unclear labels, hidden options, confusing flow logic?
- **Recovery**: When an error occurs, can the user recover without starting over? Is the recovery path obvious? Does the system preserve their progress?
- **Satisfaction**: Does the experience feel proportionate to the task? (Signing up for a newsletter should not require 6 fields and an email confirmation.)

**Metrics framework:**

- Task completion rate — percentage of attempts that reach the intended outcome
- Error rate — percentage of attempts that include at least one error
- Time-on-task — how long the task takes relative to its complexity
- Steps-to-completion — actual steps vs. minimum necessary steps
- Recovery rate — percentage of errors that the user recovers from without abandoning

You won't always have quantitative data. When evaluating designs (not live products), estimate these metrics based on your walkthrough findings. Be explicit that they're estimates, and recommend `/measure` for instrumentation to gather real data post-launch.

### 5. Assessment-to-action routing

Every finding maps to a specific Intent skill. Your output should close with a "Recommended Actions" section that explicitly names which skill addresses each issue.

**Routing logic:**

| Issue category | Route to | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Navigation, findability, information structure | `/organize` | Users can't find settings; menu labels don't match mental model |
| Copy, labels, error messages, instructions | `/articulate` | Generic error messages; jargon in UI; ambiguous button labels |
| Flow logic, task structure, interaction sequence | `/journey` | Steps out of order; dead ends in task flow; unclear entry points |
| Edge cases, empty states, loading, error recovery | `/fortify` | No loading indicator; empty states with no guidance; no undo |
| Accessibility, assistive tech, inclusive design | `/include` | Insufficient contrast; keyboard traps; missing alt text |
| System architecture, backend constraints, dependencies | `/blueprint` | UX issue caused by service timeout; data sync problems |
| Dark patterns, manipulative design | Flag + anti-pattern catalog | Confirmshaming; prechecked consent; fake urgency |
| Success metrics, measurement gaps | `/measure` | No analytics on key flows; success undefined |
| Research gaps, unanswered user questions | `/investigate` | "We don't know why users drop off here" |
| Problem framing, strategic misalignment | `/strategize` | Experience solves wrong problem; audience mismatch |
| Platform adaptation, cross-device issues | `/transpose` | Mobile experience is just a shrunk desktop; touch targets too small |
| Specification gaps, handoff issues | `/specify` | Interaction states undocumented; edge cases unspecified |
| Vague unease, qualitative wrongness | `/philosopher` | "Something feels off but I can't name it" |

**Priority mapping:** P0 issues get addressed first regardless of category. Within the same priority tier, address issues that affect the most users or the most critical tasks first. Group issues by skill when possible — it's more efficient to engage `/fortify` once for 5 edge case issues than 5 times for 1 issue each.

## Evaluation output format

Use this structure for all evaluations. Adapt depth to scope — a quick review of a single flow doesn't need every section, but a comprehensive audit does.
